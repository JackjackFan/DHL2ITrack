# DHL2ITrack <br>
--- Our tracker-v2 based on online tracker mdnet has been uploaded, and lateset version of DHL2ITrack based on dimp in 《DEEP HOMOMORPHIC FILTERING ENHANCED FUSION TRACKING NETWORK FOR LOW LIGHT AND INFRARED》 is comong soon.<br><br><br><br>
This is a low-light infared tracking method based on homomorphic filtering. Our paper has been submitted to ICASSP2024 (Shenghua Fan, Chen Sun. et.al)《DEEP HOMOMORPHIC FILTERING ENHANCED FUSION TRACKING NETWORK FOR LOW LIGHT AND INFRARED》<br><br>
